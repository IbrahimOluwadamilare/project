			<Line>From fairest creatures we desire increase,</Line>
			<Line>That thereby beauty's rose might never die,</Line>
			<Line>But as the riper should by time decease,</Line>
			<Line>His tender heir might bear his memory:</Line>
			<Line>But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,</Line>
			<Line>Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,</Line>
			<Line>Making a famine where abundance lies,</Line>
			<Line>Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:</Line>
			<Line>Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,</Line>
			<Line>And only herald to the gaudy spring,</Line>
			<Line>Within thine own bud buriest thy content,</Line>
			<Line>And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:</Line>
			<Line>Pity the world, or else this glutton be,</Line>
			<Line>To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.</Line>

			<Line>When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,</Line>
			<Line>And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,</Line>
			<Line>Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,</Line>
			<Line>Will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held: </Line>
			<Line>Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,</Line>
			<Line>Where all the treasure of thy lusty days; </Line>
			<Line>To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,</Line>
			<Line>Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.</Line>
			<Line>How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,</Line>
			<Line>If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine</Line>
			<Line>Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'</Line>
			<Line>Proving his beauty by succession thine!</Line>
			<Line>This were to be new made when thou art old,</Line>
			<Line>And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.</Line>

			<Line>Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest</Line>
			<Line>Now is the time that face should form another;</Line>
			<Line>Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,</Line>
			<Line>Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.</Line>
			<Line>For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb</Line>
			<Line>Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?</Line>
			<Line>Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,</Line>
			<Line>Of his self-love to stop posterity? </Line>
			<Line>Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee</Line>
			<Line>Calls back the lovely April of her prime;</Line>
			<Line>So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,</Line>
			<Line>Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.</Line>

			<Line>Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend</Line>
			<Line>Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?</Line>
			<Line>Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,</Line>
			<Line>And being frank she lends to those are free:</Line>
			<Line>Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse</Line>
			<Line>The bounteous largess given thee to give?</Line>
			<Line>Profitless usurer, why dost thou use</Line>
			<Line>So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?</Line>
			<Line>For having traffic with thy self alone,</Line>
			<Line>Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive:</Line>
			<Line>Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,</Line>
			<Line>What acceptable audit canst thou leave?</Line>
			<Line>Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,</Line>
			<Line>Which, used, lives th' executor to be.</Line>

			<Line>Those hours, that with gentle work did frame</Line>
			<Line>The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,</Line>
			<Line>Will play the tyrants to the very same</Line>
			<Line>And that unfair which fairly doth excel;</Line>
			<Line>For never-re sting time leads summer on</Line>
			<Line>To hideous winter, and confounds him there;</Line>
			<Line>Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,</Line>
			<Line>Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:</Line>
			<Line>Then were not summer's distillation left,</Line>
			<Line>A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,</Line>
			<Line>Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,</Line>
			<Line>Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was:</Line>
			<Line>But flowers distill'd, though they with winter meet,</Line>
			<Line>Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.</Line>
