INSERT INTO "tbDictionary" VALUES('abstract data type','n. In programming, a data set
defined by the programmer in terms of the information it
can contain and the operations that can be performed
with it. An abstract data type is more generalized than a
data type constrained by the properties of the objects it
contains—for example, the data type “pet” is more generalized
than the data types “pet dog,” “pet bird,” and “pet
fish.” The standard example used in illustrating an abstract
data type is the stack, a small portion of memory used to
store information, generally on a temporary basis. As an
abstract data type, the stack is simply a structure onto
which values can be pushed (added) and from which they
can be popped (removed). The type of value, such as integer,
is irrelevant to the definition.');
INSERT INTO "tbDictionary" VALUES('abstraction','n. 1. Broadly, the use of specialized software,
such as an application programming interface (API),
as a means of shielding software from device dependencies
or the complexities of underlying software. For
instance, hardware abstraction enables programs to focus
on a task, such as communications, instead of on individual
differences between communications devices.');
